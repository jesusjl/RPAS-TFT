International campaigns present a specific image: that parks agencies and conservation {NGOs} are engaged in a continual battle to protect wildlife from armies of highly organized criminal poachers who are financially motivated. The war to save biodiversity is presented as a legitimate war to save critically endangered species such as rhinos, tigers, gorillas and elephants. This is a significant shift in approach since the late 1990s, when community-based natural resource management ({CBNRM}) and participatory techniques were at their peak. Since the early 2000s there has been a re-evaluation of a renewed interest in fortress conservation models to protect wildlife, including by military means.1 Yet, as Lunstrum notes, there is a dearth of research on ‘green militarization', a process by which military approaches and values are increasingly embedded in conservation practice.},

	volume = {6},

	doi = {10.3390/rs6086988},
	abstract = {Gap distributions in forests reflect the spatial impact of man-made tree harvesting or naturally-induced patterns of tree death being caused by windthrow, inter-tree competition, disease or senescence. Gap sizes can vary from large ({\textgreater}100 m2) to small {\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n({\textless}10 m2), and they may have contrasting spatial patterns, such as being aggregated or regularly distributed. However, very small gaps cannot easily be recorded with conventional aerial or satellite images, which calls for new and cost-effective methodologies of forest monitoring. Here, we used an unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV}) and very high-resolution images to record the gaps in 10 temperate managed and unmanaged forests in two regions of Germany. All gaps were extracted for 1-ha study plots and subsequently analyzed with spatially-explicit statistics, such as the conventional {\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}npair correlation function ({PCF}), the polygon-based {PCF} and the mark correlation function. Gap-size frequency was dominated by small gaps of an area {\textless}5 m2, which were particularly frequent in unmanaged forests. We found that gap distances showed a variety of patterns. However, the polygon-based {PCF} was a better descriptor of patterns than the conventional {PCF}, because it showed randomness or aggregation for cases when the conventional {PCF} showed small-scale regularity; albeit, the latter was only a mathematical artifact. The mark correlation function revealed that gap areas were in half of the cases negatively correlated and in the other half independent. Negative size correlations may likely be the result of single-tree harvesting or of repeated gap formation, which both lead to nearby small gaps. Here, we emphasize the usefulness of {UAV} to record forest gaps of a very small size. These small gaps may originate from repeated gap-creating disturbances, and their spatial patterns should be monitored with spatially-explicit statistics at recurring intervals in order to further insights into forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {Large areas of tropical lands are being removed from agriculture and restored to address conservation goals. However, monitoring the ecological value of these efforts at the individual land-owner scale is rare, owing largely to issues of cost and accessibility. Traditional field-based measures for assessing forest recovery and habitat quality can be labour intensive and costly. Here we assess whether remote sensing measurements from lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAV}) are a cost-effective substitute for traditional field measures. An inexpensive {UAV}-based remote sensing methodology, "Ecosynth", was applied to measure forest canopy structure across field plots in a 7-9-yr tropical forest restoration study in southern Costa Rica. Ecosynth methods combine aerial images from consumer-grade digital cameras with computer vision software to generate 3D 'point cloud' models of vegetation at high spatial resolutions. Ecosynth canopy structure measurements were compared to field-based measures and their ability to predict the abundance of frugivorous birds; key seed dispersers that are sensitive to canopy structure. Ecosynth canopy height measurements were highly correlated with field-based measurements (R$^{\textrm{2}}$≥0.85), a result comparable in precision to {LiDAR}-based remote sensing measurements. Ecosynth parameters were also strongly correlated with above-ground biomass (R$^{\textrm{2}}$≥0.81) and percent canopy openness (R$^{\textrm{2}}$=0.82). Correlations were weaker with proportion-based measures such as canopy roughness (R$^{\textrm{2}}$=0.53). Several Ecosynth metrics (e.g., canopy openness and height) predicted frugivore presence and abundance at levels of accuracy similar to those of field-based measurements. Ecosynth {UAV} remote-sensing provides an effective alternate methodology to traditional field-based measures of evaluating forest structure and complexity across landscapes. Furthermore, given the volume of data that can be generated in a single flight plan, as well as the ability to use the technology in remote areas, these methods could expand the scope of studies on forest dynamics and recovery when combined with field-based calibration plots.},

	abstract = {Management of wetlands resources often requires assessment of changes in wetland vegetation over time. Accurate tracking of the expansion or retraction of invasive plant species is especially critical for natural resource managers who must make decisions on the deployment of effective control measures. Many available remote sensing strategies to quantify the location of invasive plant species are either too expensive to deploy on a regular basis or lack sufficient geographic or temporal resolution to be of use to resources managers. This paper presents the results of the use of a new unmanned aerial vehicle platform, called {AggieAir}\&\#x2122;, and a new classification algorithm to track the spread of an invasive grass species, Phragmites australis, in a large and important wetland in northern Utah. The combination of high resolution multi-spectral images (in space and time) and the classification algorithm based on advances in statistical learning theory produce quantitative land cover descriptions that identify Phragmites locations with an accuracy of 95 percent. The combination of these two tools provides wetlands managers with new and potentially valuable methods to quantify the spread of Phragmites and to evaluate the efficacy of their attempts to control it.},

	abstract = {Kushiro wetland in northeastern Japan is a Ramsar-designated wetland of international importance (1980) that is characterized by high biodiversity and spatial heterogeneity. These characteristics of the wetland also present innumerable challenges for mapping and monitoring such unique ecosystems. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have provided many sensors with different spatial and spectral scales and resolutions. However, they are still inadequate for mapping wetland vegetation at a large scale for various reasons, such as inadequate resolution and high costs. This study was designed to evaluate the potential of balloon aerial photography to acquire high resolution (15 cm pixel size) imagery for mapping wetland vegetation in the Akanuma marsh. We used a standard 28-mm non-metric camera (Nikon-F-801), which was mounted on helium-filled balloons operated by a remote radio-controlled system. By creating digital vegetation maps from visual interpretation of mosaicked photos, ten general types of vegetation and twenty-seven specific categories (species mixes) were successfully delineated. It was possible to classify small shrubs mixed with herbaceous plants; moss bogs with pools; dwarf shrubs with sedges; and moss with alpine plants. From this research, it seems that balloon aerial photography is a powerful tool for mapping temperate wetland vegetation, allowing classification of specific and typical vegetation types to the genus and species level.},

Currently, the widespread implementation of {UAS} by scientists is limited by flight range, regulatory frameworks, and a lack of validation. {UAS} are most effective when used to examine smaller areas close to their launch sites, whereas manned aircraft are recommended for surveying greater distances.

	abstract = {Unmanned Aircraft Systems ({UAS}) have evolved rapidly over the past decade driven primarily by military uses, and have begun finding application among civilian users for earth sensing reconnaissance and scientific data collection purposes. Among {UAS}, promising characteristics are long flight duration, improved mission safety, flight repeatability due to improving autopilots, and reduced operational costs when compared to manned aircraft. The potential advantages of an unmanned platform, however, depend on many factors, such as aircraft, sensor types, mission objectives, and the current {UAS} regulatory requirements for operations of the particular platform. The regulations concerning {UAS} operation are still in the early development stages and currently present significant barriers to entry for scientific users. In this article we describe a variety of platforms, as well as sensor capabilities, and identify advantages of each as relevant to the demands of users in the scientific research sector. We also briefly discuss the current state of regulations affecting {UAS} operations, with the purpose of informing the scientific community about this developing technology whose potential for revolutionizing natural science observations is similar to those transformations that {GIS} and {GPS} brought to the community two decades ago.},

Low cost unmanned aircraft systems ({UAS}) can provide information on the spatial pattern of hosts' distribution and abundance, which is crucial as regards modelling the determinants of disease transmission and persistence on a fine spatial scale. In this context we have studied the spatial epidemiology of tuberculosis ({TB}) in the ungulate community of Doñana National Park (South-western Spain) by modelling species host (red deer, fallow deer and cattle) abundance at fine spatial scale. The use of {UAS} high-resolution images has allowed us to collect data to model the environmental determinants of host abundance, and in a further step to evaluate their relationships with the spatial risk of {TB} throughout the ungulate community. We discuss the ecological, epidemiological and logistic conditions under which {UAS} may contribute to study the wildlife/livestock sanitary interface, where the spatial aggregation of hosts becomes crucial. These findings are relevant for planning and implementing research, fundamentally when managing disease in multi-host systems, and focusing on risky areas. Therefore, managers should prioritize the implementation of control strategies to reduce disease of conservation, economic and social relevance.},

	abstract = {The knowledge about the spatial ecology and distribution of organisms is important for both basic and applied science. Biologging is one of the most popular methods for obtaining information about spatial distribution of animals, but requires capturing the animals and is often limited by costs and data retrieval. Unmanned Aircraft Systems ({UAS}) have proven their efficacy for wildlife surveillance and habitat monitoring, but their potential contribution to the prediction of animal distribution patterns and abundance has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this study, we assess the usefulness of {UAS} overflights to (1) get data to model the distribution of free-ranging cattle for a comparison with results obtained from biologged ({GPS}-{GSM} collared) cattle and (2) predict species densities for a comparison with actual density in a protected area. {UAS} and biologging derived data models provided similar distribution patterns. Predictions from the {UAS} model overestimated cattle densities, which may be associated with higher aggregated distributions of this species. Overall, while the particular researcher interests and species characteristics will influence the method of choice for each study, we demonstrate here that {UAS} constitute a noninvasive methodology able to provide accurate spatial data useful for ecological research, wildlife management and rangeland planning.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0079556},
	abstract = {Aerial surveys of marine mammals are routinely conducted to assess and monitor species' habitat use and population status. In Australia, dugongs (Dugong dugon) are regularly surveyed and long-term datasets have formed the basis for defining habitat of high conservation value and risk assessments of human impacts. Unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) may facilitate more accurate, human-risk free, and cheaper aerial surveys. We undertook the first Australian {UAV} survey trial in Shark Bay, western Australia. We conducted seven flights of the {ScanEagle} {UAV}, mounted with a digital {SLR} camera payload. During each flight, ten transects covering a 1.3 km(2) area frequently used by dugongs, were flown at 500, 750 and 1000 ft. Image (photograph) capture was controlled via the Ground Control Station and the capture rate was scheduled to achieve a prescribed 10\% overlap between images along transect lines. Images were manually reviewed post hoc for animals and scored according to sun glitter, Beaufort Sea state and turbidity. We captured 6243 images, 627 containing dugongs. We also identified whales, dolphins, turtles and a range of other fauna. Of all possible dugong sightings, 95\% ({CI} = 90\%, 98\%) were subjectively classed as 'certain' (unmistakably dugongs). Neither our dugong sighting rate, nor our ability to identify dugongs with certainty, were affected by {UAV} altitude. Turbidity was the only environmental variable significantly affecting the dugong sighting rate. Our results suggest that {UAV} systems may not be limited by sea state conditions in the same manner as sightings from manned surveys. The overlap between images proved valuable for detecting animals that were masked by sun glitter in the corners of images, and identifying animals initially captured at awkward body angles. This initial trial of a basic camera system has successfully demonstrated that the {ScanEagle} {UAV} has great potential as a tool for marine mammal aerial surveys.},

Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAV}), artificial intelligence and miniaturized thermal imaging systems represent a new opportunity for wildlife experts to inexpensively survey relatively large areas. The system presented in this paper includes thermal image acquisition as well as a video processing pipeline to perform object detection, classification and tracking of wildlife in forest or open areas. The system is tested on thermal video data from ground based and test flight footage, and is found to be able to detect all the target wildlife located in the surveyed area. The system is flexible in that the user can readily define the types of objects to classify and the object characteristics that should be considered during classification.},

	doi = {10.1371/ journal.pone.0054700},
	abstract = {The use of a {UAS} (Unmanned Aircraft System) was tested to survey large mammals in the Nazinga Game Ranch in the south of Burkina Faso. The Gatewing6100TM equipped with a Ricoh {GR} {III} camera was used to test animal reaction as the {UAS} passed, and visibility on the images. No reaction was recorded as the {UAS} passed at a height of 100 m. Observations, made on a set of more than 7000 images, revealed that only elephants (Loxodonta africana) were easily visible while medium and small sized mammals were not. The easy observation of elephants allows experts to enumerate them on images acquired at a height of 100 m. We, therefore, implemented an aerial strip sample count along transects used for the annual wildlife foot count. A total of 34 elephants were recorded on 4 transects, each overflown twice. The elephant density was estimated at 2.47 elephants/km2 with a coefficient of variation ({CV}\%) of 36.10\%. The main drawback of our {UAS} was its low autonomy (45 min). Increased endurance of small {UAS} is required to replace manned aircraft survey of large areas (about 1000 km of transect per day vs 40 km for our {UAS}). The monitoring strategy should be adapted according to the sampling plan. Also, the {UAS} is as expensive as a second-hand light aircraft. However the logistic and flight implementation are easier, the running costs are lower and its use is safer. Technological evolution will make civil {UAS} more efficient, allowing them to compete with light aircraft for aerial wildlife surveys.},

	abstract = {Aerial surveys have developed into valuable tools for scientific research, especially wildlife management. However, problems with safety, cost, statistical integrity, and logistics plague aerial surveys taken from single-engine, manned aircraft. Small, unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) offer promise for addressing these problems and developing into a useful tool for many wildlife research applications. For this study, a 1.5-m-wingspan {UAV} equipped with autonomous control and sophisticated video equipment was purchased for {US}\$35,000. This {UAV} was used to test the potential usefulness of such an aircraft for certain wildlife research applications in Florida. The {UAV} completed in excess of 30 missions over the course of two years before finally crashing into salt water due to engine failure. On these missions, the {UAV} captured high quality, progressive-scan video of a number of habitat types and wildlife species (white ibis (Eudocimus albus), other white wading birds, American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), and Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris). The autonomous control system worked satisfactorily, but the {UAV} system was unable to collect geo-referenced imagery and was extremely difficult to deploy in unimproved areas. The performance of the autonomous control system and the quality of the progressive scan imagery indicated strong promise for future {UAVs} as useful research tools. Different research applications will call for different {UAV} systems according to the sensors required (autonomous control, video, still photos, radio telemetry, etc.) and the distance required to reach/cover the area of interest. Larger {UAVs} can fly longer and carry more payload but are more expensive and difficult to operate. {UAVs} with a 1-2 m wingspan offer promise for a variety of wildlife research applications, having the ability to fly for 45-60 minutes and carry up to 3 kg of payload (sensors, autonomous control equipment, batteries). Recommendations for wildlife {UAVs} are that they be extremely durable (carbon fiber, Kevlar construction), modular (replaceable wing, tail, fuselage, engine, etc.), powered by an electric engine with lithium batteries, able to launch and land in vegetated areas (15 m by 50 m clearing), autonomously controlled, and operable by a minimally trained (two months) wildlife biologist.},

In this study, we describe the combined use of {GPS} data logger information obtained from free-ranging birds, and environmental information recorded by unmanned aerial systems ({UASs}). As a case study, we studied habitat selection of a small raptorial bird, the lesser kestrel Falco naumanni, foraging in a highly dynamic landscape. After downloading spatio-temporal information from data loggers attached to the birds, we programmed the {UASs} to fly and take imagery by means of an onboard digital camera documenting the flight paths of those same birds shortly after their recorded flights. This methodology permitted us to extract environmental information at quasi-real time. We demonstrate that {UASs} are a useful tool for a wide variety of wildlife studies.},

The advantages of small-scale {RPVs} include pilot safety, fast data turnaround time, low capital and per-flight costs, ease in flight planning, quick response for targets of opportunity, and the potential to gather ultrahigh resolution pictures in situations where in situ data gathering is impossible. Significant limitations of small-scale {RPVs} include their low stability as photographic platforms; short flight times, airframe fragility, the paucity of sensor packages available, and the difficulties involved integrating pilot-assist flight navigation systems. Further development is required before small-scale {RPVs} will be accepted as mainstream tools for environmental monitoring. Besides discovering and validating environmental applications of the technology, this work includes the design of inexpensive lightweight sensor packages for environmental tasks and the improvement of image processing algorithms to interpret, rectify, and manage {RPV} imagery.},

	doi = {10.3390/f5061481},
	abstract = {Data gathered through community-based forest monitoring ({CBFM}) programs may be as accurate as those gathered by professional scientists, but acquired at a much lower cost and capable of providing more detailed data about the occurrence, extent and drivers of forest loss, degradation and regrowth at the community scale. In addition, {CBFM} enables greater survey repeatability. Therefore, {CBFM} should be a fundamental component of national forest monitoring systems and programs to measure, report and verify ({MRV}) {REDD}+ activities. To contribute to the development of more effective approaches to {CBFM}, in this paper we assess: (1) the feasibility of using small, low-cost drones (i.e., remotely piloted aerial vehicles) in {CBFM} programs; (2) their potential advantages and disadvantages for communities, partner organizations and forest data end-users; and (3) to what extent their utilization, coupled with ground surveys and local ecological knowledge, would improve tropical forest monitoring. To do so, we reviewed the existing literature regarding environmental applications of drones, including forest monitoring, and drew on our own firsthand experience flying small drones to map and monitor tropical forests and training people to operate them. We believe that the utilization of small drones can enhance {CBFM} and that this approach is feasible in many locations throughout the tropics if some degree of external assistance and funding is provided to communities. We suggest that the use of small drones can help tropical communities to better manage and conserve their forests whilst benefiting partner organizations, governments and forest data end-users, particularly those engaged in forestry, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation projects such as {REDD}+.},

	abstract = {Very high-resolution ({VHR}) image data, including from unmanned aerial vehicle ({UAV}) platforms, are increasingly acquired for wildlife surveys. Animals or structures they build (e.g. nests) can be photointerpreted from these images, how-ever, automated detection is required for more efficient surveys. We developed semi-automated analyses to map white-bellied sea eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster) nests in {VHR} aerial photographs of the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Aus-tralia, an important breeding site for many seabird species. Nest detection is com-plicated by high environmental heterogeneity at the scale of nests (\${\textbackslash}sim\$1–2 m), the presence of many features that resemble nests and the variability of nest size, shape and context. Finally, the rarity of nests limits the availability of training data. These challenges are not unique to wildlife surveys and we show how they can be overcome by an innovative integration of object-based image analyses ({OBIA}) and the powerful machine learning one-class classifier Maxent. Maxent classifications using features characterizing object texture, geometry and neigh-borhood, along with limited object color information, successfully identified over 90\% of high quality nests (most weathered and unusually shaped nests were also detected, but at a slightly lower rate) and labeled {\textless}2\% of objects as candidate nests. Although this overestimates the occurrence of nests, the results can be visu-ally screened to rule out all but the most likely nests in a process that is simpler and more efficient than manual photointerpretation of the full image. Our study shows that semi-automated image analyses for wildlife surveys are achievable. Furthermore, the developed strategies have broad relevance to image processing applications that seek to detect rare features differing only subtly from a heteroge-neous background, including remote sensing of archeological remains. We also highlight solutions to maximize the use of imperfect or uncalibrated image data, such as some {UAV}-based imagery and the growing body of {VHR} imagery avail-able in Google Earth and other virtual globes.},

	abstract = {Over the last years there has been a massive increase in rhinoceros poaching incidents, with more than two individuals killed per day in South Africa in the first months of 2013. Immediate actions are needed to preserve current populations and the agents involved in their protection are demanding new technologies to increase their efficiency in the field. We assessed the use of remotely piloted aircraft systems ({RPAS}) to monitor for poaching activities. We performed 20 flights with 3 types of cameras: visual photo, {HD} video and thermal video, to test the ability of the systems to detect (a) rhinoceros, (b) people acting as poachers and (c) to do fence surveillance. The study area consisted of several large game farms in {KwaZulu}-Natal province, South Africa. The targets were better detected at the lowest altitudes, but to operate the plane safely and in a discreet way, altitudes between 100 and 180 m were the most convenient. Open areas facilitated target detection, while forest habitats complicated it. Detectability using visual cameras was higher at morning and midday, but the thermal camera provided the best images in the morning and at night. Considering not only the technical capabilities of the systems but also the poacherś modus operandi and the current control methods, we propose {RPAS} usage as a tool for surveillance of sensitive areas, for supporting field anti-poaching operations, as a deterrent tool for poachers and as a complementary method for rhinoceros ecology research. Here, we demonstrate that low cost {RPAS} can be useful for rhinoceros stakeholders for field control procedures. There are, however, important practical limitations that should be considered for their successful and realistic integration in the anti-poaching battle.},

Their use has the potential to revolutionise the field if they prove capable of improving data quality or the ease with which data are collected beyond traditional methods. We apply {UAV} technology to wildlife monitoring in tropical and polar environments and demonstrate that {UAV}-derived counts of colony nesting birds are an order of magnitude more precise than traditional ground counts. The increased count precision afforded by {UAVs}, along with their ability to survey hard-to-reach populations and places, will likely drive many wildlife monitoring projects that rely on population counts to transition from traditional methods to {UAV} technology. Careful consideration will be required to ensure the coherence of historic data sets with new {UAV}-derived data and we propose a method for determining the number of duplicated (concurrent {UAV} and ground counts) sampling points needed to achieve data compatibility.},

	abstract = {Conventional aircraft have been used for photogrammetry studies of free-ranging whales, but are often not practical in remote regions or not affordable. Here we report on the use of a small, unmanned hexacopter ({APH}-22; Aerial Imaging Solutions) as an alter-native method for collecting photographs to measure killer whales (Orcinus orca) at sea. We deployed and retrieved the hexacopter by hand during 60 flights (average duration 13.2 min, max 15.7 min) from the upper deck of an 8.2 m boat, utilizing the aircraft's vertical takeoff and landing ({VTOL}) capability. The hexacopter was quiet and stable in flight, and therefore could be flown at relatively low altitudes without disturbing whales. The payload was a Micro Four-Thirds system camera that was used to obtain 18920 still images from an altitude of 35–40 m above the whales. Tests indicated a ground-resolved distance of {\textless}1.4 cm across the full extent of a flat and undistorted field of view, and an onboard pressure altimeter enabled measurements in pixels to be scaled to true size with an average accuracy of 5 cm. As a result, the images were sharp enough to differentiate individual whales using natural markings (77 whales in total) and preliminary estimates resolved differences in whale lengths ranging from 2.6 to 5.8 m. This first application at sea demonstrated the {APH}-22 hexacopter to be a safe and cost-effective platform for collecting photogrammetry images to fill key scientific data gaps about whales, and we anticipate this utility will extend to studies of other wildlife species.},

	abstract = {Campania Region of Southern Italy has a complex environmental situation, due to geogenic and anthropogenic soil pollution. Some of the pollutants such as copper are mobilized in the organic matter. It has been shown that wetlands provide physical as well as biogeochemical barriers against pollutants. Therefore, the objective of this study was to introduce and test an innovative approach able to predict copper accumulation points at plot scales, using a combination of aerial photos, taken by drones, micro-rill network modelling and wetland prediction indices usually used at catchment scales. Data were collected from an area measuring 4500m2 in Trentola Ducenta locality of Caserta Province of southern Italy. The photos processing with a fifth generation software for photogrammetry resulted in a high resolution Digital Elevation Model ({DEM}), used to study micro-rill processes. The {DEM} was also used to test the ability of Topographic Index ({TI}) and the Clima-Topographic Index ({CTI}) to predict copper sedimentation points at plot scale (0.1-10ha) by comparing the map of the predicted and the actual copper distribution in the field. The {DEM} obtained with a resolution of 30mm showed a high potential for the study of micro-rill processes and {TI} and {CTI} indices were able to predict zones of copper accumulation at a plot scale.},

We introduce a method to estimate the reachable workspace volume for an individual by capturing their observed joint limits using a low cost depth camera. This method is then tested on seven individuals with varying upper limb performance. Based on these initial trials, we found that the reachable workspace volume decreased as muscular impairment increased. This shows the potential for this method to be used as a quantitative clinical assessment tool.},

	abstract = {There are now over 100000 protected areas worldwide, covering over 12\% of the Earth's land surface. These areas represent one of the most significant human resource use allocations on the planet. The importance of protected areas is reflected in their widely accepted role as an indicator for global targets and environmental assessments. However, measuring the number and extent of protected areas only provides a unidimensional indicator of political commitment to biodiversity conservation. Data on the geographic location and spatial extent of protected areas will not provide information on a key determinant for meeting global biodiversity targets: 'effectiveness' in conserving biodiversity. Although tools are being devised to assess management effectiveness, there is no globally accepted metric. Nevertheless, the numerical, spatial and geographic attributes of protected areas can be further enhanced by investigation of the biodiversity coverage of these protected areas, using species, habitats or biogeographic classifications. This paper reviews the current global extent of protected areas in terms of geopolitical and habitat coverage, and considers their value as a global indicator of conservation action or response. The paper discusses the role of the World Database on Protected Areas and collection and quality control issues, and identifies areas for improvement, including how conservation effectiveness indicators may be included in the database to improve the value of protected areas data as an indicator for meeting global biodiversity targets.},

	abstract = {Monitoring of animal populations is essential for conservation management. Various techniques are available to assess spatiotemporal patterns of species distribution and abundance. Nest surveys are often used for monitoring great apes. Quickly developing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) can be used to complement these ground-based surveys, especially for covering large areas rapidly. Aerial surveys have been used successfully to detect the nests of orang-utans. It is unknown if such an approach is practical for African apes, which usually build their nests at lower heights, where they might be obscured by forest canopy. In this 2-month study, {UAV}-derived aerial imagery was used for two distinct purposes: testing the detectability of chimpanzee nests and identifying fruiting trees used by chimpanzees in Loango National Park (Gabon). Chimpanzee nest data were collected through two approaches: we located nests on the ground and then tried to detect them in {UAV} photos and vice versa. Ground surveys were conducted using line transects, reconnaissance trails, and opportunistic sampling during which we detected 116 individual nests in 28 nest groups. In complementary {UAV} images we detected 48\% of the individual nests (68\% of nest groups) in open coastal forests and 8\% of individual nests (33\% of nest groups) in closed canopy inland forests. The key factor for nest detectability in {UAV} imagery was canopy openness. Data on fruiting trees were collected from five line transects. In 122 {UAV} images 14 species of trees (N = 433) were identified, alongside 37 tree species (N = 205) in complementary ground surveys. Relative abundance of common tree species correlated between ground and {UAV} surveys. We conclude that {UAVs} have great potential as a rapid assessment tool for detecting chimpanzee presence in forest with open canopy and assessing fruit tree availability. {UAVs} may have limited applicability for nest detection in closed canopy forest.},

Equipped with capable sensors, {UAVs} can deliver fine spatial resolution data at temporal resolutions defined by the end user.

Protected areas are presented as localized sites to address global crises, such as anthropogenic climate change and the "war on terror." When they are sites for securitization and militarization, protected areas articulate state and subject formations through violence. As threat discourses have amplified in recent years, communities once deemed putative eco-destroyers have been interpellated as potential threats in wars on drugs and/or terror. The themed issue reveals that reframing environmental crime as organized crime has significant implications for expanding claims of what counts as legitimate use of force in protected areas policing, as well as potential prosecutions. It is apparent that security for one group may hinge on the insecurity of another group at different historical and political moments. In this special issue we challenge conservation actors as well as those critical of conservation to ask: for whom does conservation provide security, under what circumstances, and at what cost?},

To achieve this, Federal Aviation Administration ({FAA}) regulations have to be followed to assure public safety. {UAS} operators need to know that {FAA} safety regulations, which incorporate line-of-sight restrictions, will only allow slow progress towards an operational system, and they must plan accordingly for the extra time necessary to prepare and complete flight missions. By following approved safety procedures, {UAS} operators can develop a {UAS} flight team that is capable of accomplishing missions anywhere in the United States while contributing to a totally integrated {NAS} comprised of all aircraft systems that can be used jointly for natural resources management. At the same time, it is hoped that {FAA} regulations will change in the future based on the capabilities and experience of the {UAS} flight team and on the locale in which operations take place, especially over large, remote, and sparsely populated areas.},

Monitoring of species for conservation is then essential, and the development of census protocols has to be chased. {UAV} technology is considering as one of the new perspectives for wildlife survey. Indeed, this technique has many advantages but its main drawback is the generation of a huge amount of data to handle. This study aims at developing an algorithm for automatic count of hippos, by exploiting thermal infrared aerial images acquired from {UAV}. This attempt is the first known for automatic detection of this species. Images taken at several flight heights can be used as inputs of the algorithm, ranging from 38 to 155 meters above ground level. A Graphical User Interface has been created in order to facilitate the use of the application. Three categories of animals have been defined following their position in water. The mean error of automatic counts compared with manual delineations is +2.3\% and shows that the estimation is unbiased. Those results show great perspectives for the use of the algorithm in populations monitoring after some technical improvements and the elaboration of statistically robust inventories protocols.},

An intensifying yet surprisingly understudied trend around theworld, this is the use of military and paramilitary personnel, training, technologies, and partnerships in the pursuit of conservation efforts. I introduce this concept, first, as a call for more sustained scholarly investigation into the militarization of conservation practice. More modestly, the article offers its own contribution to this end by turning to {SouthAfrica}'s Kruger National Park, the world's most concentrated site of commercial rhino poaching. Focusing on the state's multilayered and increasingly lethal militarized response to what is itself a highlymilitarized practice, I illustrate how the spatial qualities of protected areas matter immensely for the convergence of conservation and militarization and the concrete forms this convergence takes. For Kruger, these include its status as a national park framed by a semiporous international border and its expansive, often dense terrain. Steering clear of spatial determinism, I equally show how spatial contours authorize militarization only once they articulate with particular assumptions and values; for Kruger these amount to political–ecological values regarding the nation-state, its sovereignty, and its natural heritage.The result is an intensifying interlocking of conservation and militarization that frequently produces unforeseen consequences.},

Operating under a restrictive line-of-sight permit from Transport Canada, we successfully collected high quality photographs of bowhead whales and none of the whales overflown responded to the overflights in an observable manner. If the {UAS} were operated under a beyond-line-of-sight permit, the {UAS} could be used to search for whales ahead of and to the side of the survey vessels making it more efficient to find whales to photograph.

A low-end model was evaluated for surveying flocks of Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) and Snow Geese (Chen caerule- scens) by comparing photographic counts from repeated flybys to repeated visual ground counts. Due to low contrast of Canada Geese with the ground, {UAS} counts based on confident detections only had a lower mean than ground counts for five out of six flocks ({\textgreater}30\% lower for three flocks) and coefficients of variation ({CV}) ranging from 11-106\%, compared to 1-6\% for ground counts. Conversely, {UAS} counts of high-contrast Snow Geese were 60\% higher on aver- age and less variable ({CV} = 1-6\%) than ground counts ({CV} = 11\%). In some cases the aircraft likely detected birds that were not seen from the ground due to an obstructed view. Shortcomings of the {UAS} were mainly related to its unsophisticated imaging system compared to more expensive models. Otherwise, the {UAS} proved capable of being conveniently transported and deployed over flocks without causing them to flush. Further consideration should be given to off-the-shelf {UAS} for surveying waterbirds over small areas ({\textless}5-km radius) that are difficult to survey from the ground or as an option for performing low-disturbance surveys.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAV}), or drones, have been used widely in military applications, but more recently civilian applications have emerged (e.g., wildlife population monitoring, traffic monitoring, law enforcement, oil and gas pipeline threat detection). {UAV} can have several advantages over manned aircraft for wildlife surveys, including reduced ecological footprint, increased safety, and the ability to collect high-resolution geo-referenced imagery that can document the presence of species without the use of a human observer. We illustrate how geo-referenced data collected with {UAV} technology in combination with recently developed statistical models can improve our ability to estimate the distribution of organisms. To demonstrate the efficacy of this methodology, we conducted an experiment in which tennis balls were used as surrogates of organisms to be surveyed. We used a {UAV} to collect images of an experimental field with a known number of tennis balls, each of which had a certain probability of being hidden. We then applied spatially explicit occupancy models to estimate the number of balls and created precise distribution maps. We conducted three consecutive surveys over the experimental field and estimated the total number of balls to be 328 (95\%{CI}: 312, 348). The true number was 329 balls, but simple counts based on the {UAV} pictures would have led to a total maximum count of 284. The distribution of the balls in the field followed a simulated environmental gradient. We also were able to accurately estimate the relationship between the gradient and the distribution of balls. Our experiment demonstrates how this technology can be used to create precise distribution maps in which discrete regions of the study area are assigned a probability of presence of an object. Finally, we discuss the applicability and relevance of this experimental study to the case study of Florida manatee distribution at power plants.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As with any technology in its infancy, case studies offer opportunities to explore drawbacks and limitations, both anticipated and unanticipated. We examined the relationship between flight altitude and camera focal length on bird identification. We then conducted a post-hoc analysis to examine the effect of flight altitude on bird flushing behavior. We flew {UAS} missions at three locations in California and Nevada to assess the use of {UAS} for censusing non-nesting waterbirds. A minimum pixel resolution of approximately 5 mm was needed be able to identify most waterbird species from imagery. Sensors needed to be carefully calibrated in order to obtain images of sufficient quality to identify waterbirds over open water. Our results suggest that gas-powered {UAS} may result in increased rates of flushing at low flight altitudes for some waterbirds. With careful design of surveys and processing workflow, {UAS} show promise for censusing and monitoring waterbirds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Mycotoxins are small ({MW} approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction ({LLE}), supercritical fluid extraction ({SFE}), solid phase extraction ({SPE}), (b) separation methods such as ({TLC}), high performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}), gas chromatography ({GC}), and capillary electrophoresis ({CE}) and (c) others such as {ELISA}. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Sensors for air and water pollutants, and subsets of the elec- tromagnetic spectrum, have become smaller, cheaper, and more bundled into comprehensive units. Aerial sensor platforms have also expanded in the form of low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (micro-drones), but their use in popu- lated spaces is increasingly restricted for safety and privacy reasons. This arti- cle discusses potential applications of drones for use in environmental moni- toring and management of urban spaces as well as the potential risks. Applica- tions better suited to an Internet of Things approach include those in which frequently repeated or continuous measurements are needed from a location proximal to existing infrastructure. Surveillance applications are likely to move to higher altitude drones with better safety and security systems. The main niche for small drones is difficult to access spaces under which there are few to no people, but this still includes many potential applications.},

This paper addresses the question of how and particularly when Unmanned Aerial System ({UAS}) should be used in order to efficiently discriminate deciduous tree species. The goal of this research is to determine when is the best time window to achieve an optimal species discrimination. A time series of high resolution {UAS} imagery was collected to cover the growing season from leaf flush to leaf fall. Full benefit was taken of the temporal resolution of {UAS} acquisition, one of the most promising features of small drones. The disparity in forest tree phenology is at the maximum during early spring and late autumn. But the phenology state that optimized the classification result is the one that minimizes the spectral variation within tree species groups and, at the same time, maximizes the phenologic differences between species. Sunlit tree crowns (5 deciduous species groups) were classified using a Random Forest approach for monotemporal, two-date and three-date combinations. The end of leaf flushing was the most efficient single-date time window. Multitemporal datasets definitely improve the overall classification accuracy. But single-date high resolution orthophotomosaics, acquired on optimal time-windows, result in a very good classification accuracy (overall out of bag error of 16\%).},

Accordingly, this paper presents the methodological and experimental aspects of correctly implementing a {UAV}-photogrammetry system.

The software of the system includes the in-house programs specifically designed for camera calibration, platform calibration, system integration, on-board data acquisition, flight planning and on-the-job self-calibration. The detailed features of the system are discussed, and solutions are proposed in order to enhance the system and its photogrammetric outputs. The developed system is extensively tested for precise modeling of the challenging environment of an open-pit gravel mine. The accuracy of the results is evaluated under various mapping conditions, including direct georeferencing and indirect georeferencing with different numbers, distributions and types of ground control points. Additionally, the effects of imaging configuration and network stability on modeling accuracy are assessed. The experiments demonstrated that 1.55 m horizontal and 3.16 m vertical absolute modeling accuracy could be achieved via direct geo-referencing, which was improved to 0.4 cm and 1.7 cm after indirect geo-referencing.},

	abstract = {Tropical deforestation continues to be a major driver of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. Remote sensing technology is increasingly used to assess changes in forest cover, species distributions and carbon stocks. However, satellite and airborne sensors can be prohibitively costly and inaccessible for researchers in developing countries. Here, we describe the development and use of an inexpensive ({\textless}\$2,000) unmanned aerial vehicle for surveying and mapping forests and biodiversity (referred to as Conservation Drone hereafter). Our prototype drone is able to fly pre-programmed missions autonomously for a total flight time of {\textbackslash}sim25 minutes and over a distance of {\textbackslash}sim15 km. Non-technical operators can program each mission by defining waypoints along a flight path using an open-source software. This drone can record videos at up to 1080 pixel resolution (high definition), and acquire aerial photographs of {\textless}10 cm pixel resolution. Aerial photographs can be stitched together to produce real-time geo-referenced land use/cover maps of surveyed areas. We evaluate the performance of this prototype Conservation Drone based on a series of test flights in Aras Napal, Sumatra, Indonesia. We discuss the further development of Conservation Drone 2.0, which will have a bigger payload and longer range. Initial tests suggest a flight time of {\textbackslash}sim50 minutes and a range of {\textbackslash}sim25 km. Finally, we highlight the potential of this system for environmental and conservation applications, which include near real-time mapping of local land cover, monitoring of illegal forest activities, and surveying of large animal species.},

Traditional methods of ob- servation with manned ships are expensive and, unless the vessel can survey at high-speed, unrealistic. Autonomous underwater vehicles ({AUVs}) are robotic platforms that have been making steady gains in sampling capabilities and impacting oceanographic observations especially in coastal areas. However, their reach is still limited by operating constraints related to their energy sources. Unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) recently introduced in coastal and polar oceanographic experiments have added to the mix in observation strategy and methods. They offer a tantalizing opportunity to bridge such scales in operational oceanog- raphy by coordinating with {AUVs} in the water-column to get in-situ measurements. In this paper, we articulate the principal challenges in operating {UAVs} with {AUVs} making synoptic observations for such targeted water- column sampling. We do so in the context of autonomous control and operation for networked robotics and describe novel experiments while articulating the key challenges and lessons learned.},

	abstract = {A new aerial platform has risen recently for image acquisition, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ({UAV}). This article describes the technical specifications and configuration of a {UAV} used to capture remote images for early season site- specific weed management ({ESSWM}). Image spatial and spectral properties required for weed seedling discrimination were also evaluated. Two different sensors, a still visible camera and a six-band multispectral camera, and three flight altitudes (30, 60 and 100 m) were tested over a naturally infested sunflower field. The main phases of the {UAV} workflow were the following: 1) mission planning, 2) {UAV} flight and image acquisition, and 3) image pre-processing. Three different aspects were needed to plan the route: flight area, camera specifications and {UAV} tasks. The pre-processing phase included the correct alignment of the six bands of the multispectral imagery and the orthorectification and mosaicking of the individual images captured in each flight. The image pixel size, area covered by each image and flight timing were very sensitive to flight altitude. At a lower altitude, the {UAV} captured images of finer spatial resolution, although the number of images needed to cover the whole field may be a limiting factor due to the energy required for a greater flight length and computational requirements for the further mosaicking process. Spectral differences between weeds, crop and bare soil were significant in the vegetation indices studied (Excess Green Index, Normalised Green-Red Difference Index and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), mainly at a 30 m altitude. However, greater spectral separability was obtained between vegetation and bare soil with the index {NDVI}. These results suggest that an agreement among spectral and spatial resolutions is needed to optimise the flight mission according to every agronomical objective as affected by the size of the smaller object to be discriminated (weed plants or weed patches).},

	abstract = {In this study, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) as a quick and safe method for monitoring biotic resources was evaluated. Vegetation cover and the amount of bare ground are important factors in understanding the sustainability of many ecosystems. Methods that improve speed and cost efficiency could greatly improve how biotic resources are monitored on western lands. Sagebrush steppe ecosystems provide important habitat for a variety of species including sage grouse and pygmy rabbit. Improved methods of monitoring these habitats are needed because not enough resource specialists or funds are available for comprehensive on-the-ground evaluations. In this project, two {UAV} platforms, fixed-wing and helicopter, were used to collect still-frame imagery to assess vegetation cover in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. This paper discusses the process for collecting and analyzing imagery from the {UAVs} to 1) estimate percentage of cover for six different vegetation types (shrub, dead shrub, grass, forb, litter, and bare ground) and 2) locate sage grouse using representative decoys. The field plots were located on the Idaho National Laboratory site west of Idaho Falls, Idaho, in areas with varying amounts and types of vegetation cover. A software program called {SamplePoint} was used along with visual inspection to evaluate percentage of cover for the six cover types. Results were compared against standard field measurements to assess accuracy. The comparison of fixed-wing and helicopter {UAV} technology against field estimates shows good agreement for the measurement of bare ground. This study shows that if a high degree of detail and data accuracy is desired, then a helicopter {UAV} may be a good platform to use. If the data collection objective is to assess broad-scale landscape level changes, then the collection of imagery with a fixed-wing system is probably more appropriate.},

Unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) offer a viable alternative to conventional platforms for acquiring high-resolution remote-sensing data at lower cost and increased operational flexibility. {UAVs} include various configurations of unmanned aircraft, multirotor helicopters (e.g., quadcopters), and balloons/blimps of different sizes and shapes. Quadcopters and balloons fill a gap between satellites and aircraft when a stationary monitoring platform is needed for relatively long-term observation of an area. {UAVs} have advanced designs to carry small payloads and integrated flight control systems, giving them semiautonomous or fully autonomous flight capabilities. Miniaturized sensors are being developed/adapted for {UAV} payloads, including hyperspectral imagers, {LIDAR}, synthetic aperture radar, and thermal infrared sensors. {UAVs} are now used for a wide range of environmental applications, such as coast...},

Current {UASs}, however, are largely relegated to collecting data while flying remotely, far away in the air. This article examines two case studies where micro-{UASs} fly in immediate proximity to the environment, enabling them to collect physical samples and capture sensor data that cannot be obtained at a distance. The first case study presents an aerial water sampler that flies to remote locations and dips a pump into the water to collect samples for lab analysis. The second case study examines a {UAS} that flies within a meter of crops to accurately measure their height. Each requires different sensors and methods specifically tailored to operating and interacting near the environment. This article evaluates the performance of these systems and also presents preliminary validation that they collect datasets that are compatible with those gathered by existing approaches. Futhermore, it distills some common underlying design and operating principles shared by {UASs} aimed at working close to the environment. Finally, this article concludes that in spite of numerous pending challenges, {UASs} that directly interact with the environment will transform the way environmental data is collected.},

Currently, despite large regulatory hurdles [5], {UAVs} are being deployed by researchers and conservationists to monitor threats to biodiversity [6], collect frequent aerial imagery [7-9], estimate population abundance [4, 10], and deter poaching [11]. Studies have examined the behavioral responses of wildlife to aircraft [12-20] (including {UAVs} [21]), but with the widespread increase in {UAV} flights, it is critical to understand whether {UAVs} act as stressors to wildlife and to quantify that impact. Biologger technology allows for the remote monitoring of stress responses in free-roaming individuals [22], and when linked to locational information, it can be used to determine events [19, 23, 24] or components of an animal's environment [25] that elicit a physiological response not apparent based on behavior alone. We assessed effects of {UAV} flights on movements and heart rate responses of free-roaming American black bears. We observed consistently strong physiological responses but infrequent behavioral changes. All bears, including an individual denned for hibernation, responded to {UAV} flights with elevated heart rates, rising as much as 123 beats per minute above the pre-flight baseline. It is important to consider the additional stress on wildlife from {UAV} flights when developing regulations and best scientific practices.},

Key to their success is the accurate and rapid characterisation of physical features (i.e., hydromorphology) along the river. Image pattern recognition techniques have been successfully used for this purpose. The reliability of the methodology depends on both the quality of the aerial imagery {\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}nand the pattern recognition technique used. Recent studies have proved the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ({UAVs}) to increase the quality of the imagery by capturing high resolution photography. Similarly, Artificial Neural Networks ({ANN}) have been shown to be a high precision tool for automated recognition of environmental patterns. This paper presents a {UAV} based framework for the identification of hydromorphological features from high resolution {RGB} aerial imagery using a novel classification technique based on {ANNs}. The framework is developed for a 1.4 km river reach along the river Dee in Wales, United Kingdom. For this purpose, a Falcon 8 octocopter was used to gather {\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n2.5 cm resolution imagery. The results show that the accuracy of the framework is above 81\%, performing particularly well at recognising vegetation. These results leverage the use of {UAVs} for environmental policy implementation and demonstrate the potential of {ANNs} and {RGB} imagery for high precision river monitoring and river management.},

	abstract = {In agricultural mowing operations, thousands of animals are injured or killed each year, due to the increased working widths and speeds of agricultural machinery. Detection and recognition of wildlife within the agricultural fields is important to reduce wildlife mortality and, thereby, promote wildlife-friendly farming. The work presented in this paper contributes to the automated detection and classification of animals in thermal imaging. The methods and results are based on top-view images taken manually from a lift to motivate work towards unmanned aerial vehicle-based detection and recognition. Hot objects are detected based on a threshold dynamically adjusted to each frame. For the classification of animals, we propose a novel thermal feature extraction algorithm. For each detected object, a thermal signature is calculated using morphological operations. The thermal signature describes heat characteristics of objects and is partly invariant to translation, rotation, scale and posture. The discrete cosine transform ({DCT}) is used to parameterize the thermal signature and, thereby, calculate a feature vector, which is used for subsequent classification. Using a k-nearest-neighbor ({kNN}) classifier, animals are discriminated from non-animals with a balanced classification accuracy of 84.7\% in an altitude range of 3-10 m and an accuracy of 75.2\% for an altitude range of 10-20 m. To incorporate temporal information in the classification, a tracking algorithm is proposed. Using temporal information improves the balanced classification accuracy to 93.3\% in an altitude range 3-10 of meters and 77.7\% in an altitude range of 10-20 m.},

	abstract = {Quantifying plant biomass and related processes such as element allocation is a major challenge at the scale of entire riparian zones. We applied sub-decimetre-resolution (5 cm) remote sensing using an unmanned aircraft system ({UAS}) in combination with field sampling to quantify riparian vegetation biomass at three locations (320-m river stretches) along a mining-impacted boreal river and estimated the amounts of Cd, Cu, and Zn stored in the dominant species. A species-level vegetation map was derived from visual interpretation of aerial images acquired using the {UAS} and field sampling to determine species composition and cover. Herbaceous and shrub biomass and metal contents were assessed by combining the vegetation maps with field sampling results. Riparian zone productivity decreased from 9.5 to 5.4 t ha-1 with increasing distance from the source of contamination, and the total amount of vegetation-bound Cd and Zn decreased from 24 to 0.4 and 3,488 to 211 g, respectively. Most Cu was stored at the central location. Biomass and metal contents indicated large variation between species. Salix spp. comprised only 17\% of the total dominant-species biomass but contained 95\% of all Cd and 65\% of all Zn. In contrast, Carex rostrata/vesicaria comprised 64\% of the total dominant-species biomass and contained 63\% of all Cu and 25\% of all Zn. Our study demonstrates the applicability of {UAS} for monitoring entire riparian zones. The method offers great potential for accurately assessing nutrient and trace element cycling in the riparian zone and for planning potential phytoremediation measures in polluted areas. © Springer International Publishing 2014.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the distribution and abundance of predators is integral to many ecological studies, but can be difficult in remote settings such as Antarctica. Recent ad-vances in the development of unmanned aerial systems ({UAS}), particularly vertical takeoff and landing ({VTOL}) aircraft, have provided a new tool for studying the distri-bution and abundance of predator populations. We detail our experience and testing in selecting a {VTOL} platform for use in remote, windy, perennially overcast settings, where ac-quiring cloud-free high-resolution satellite images is often impractical. We present results from the first use of {VTOLs} for estimating abundance, colony area, and density of krill-dependent predators in Antarctica, based upon 65 missions flown in 2010/2011 (n = 28) and 2012/2013 (n = 37). We address concerns over {UAS} sound affecting wildlife by comparing {VTOL}-generated noise to ambient and penguin-generated sound. We also report on the utility of {VTOLs} for missions other than abundance and distribution, namely to estimate size of individual leopard seals. Several character-istics of small, battery-powered {VTOLs} make them par-ticularly useful in wildlife applications: (1) portability, (2) stability in flight, (3) limited launch area requirements, (4) safety, and (5) limited sound when compared to fixed-wing and internal combustion engine aircraft. We conclude that of the numerous {UAS} available, electric {VTOLs} are among the most promising for ecological applications.},

The recent development of drones or unmanned aircraft systems ({UASs}) opens new opportunities. {UASs} have several advantages, including providing data at high spatial and temporal resolution, providing systematic, permanent data, having low operational costs and being low-risk for the operators. However, {UASs} have some constraints, such as short flight endurance. * We reviewed studies in which wildlife populations were monitored by using drones, described accomplishments to date and evaluated the range of possibilities {UASs} offer to provide new perspectives in future research. * We focused on four main topics: 1) the available systems and sensors; 2) the types of survey plan and detection possibilities; 3) contributions towards anti-poaching surveillance; and 4) legislation and ethics. * We found that small fixed-wing {UASs} are most commonly used because these aircraft provide a viable compromise between price, logistics and flight endurance. The sensors are typically electro-optic or infrared cameras, but there is the potential to develop and test new sensors. * Despite various flight plan possibilities, mostly classical line transects have been employed, and it would be of great interest to test new methods to adapt to the limitations of {UASs}. Detection of many species is possible, but statistical approaches are unavailable if valid inventories of large mammals are the purpose. * Contributions of {UASs} to anti-poaching surveillance are not yet well documented in the scientific literature, but initial studies indicate that this approach could make important contributions to conservation in the next few years. * Finally, we conclude that one of the main factors impeding the use of {UASs} is legislation. Restrictions in the use of airspace prevent researchers from testing all possibilities, and adaptations to the relevant legislation will be necessary in future.},

Recently researchers started to use unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs} or drones) for wildlife and habitat monitoring. Here we tested whether we could detect nests of the critically endangered Sumatran orang-utan on imagery acquired from a camera-mounted drone to determine distribution and density. Our results show that the distribution of nests compares well between aerial and ground-based surveys and that relative density (nest/km) shows a significant correlation between these two survey types. The results also indicate that both methods can be used to detect significant differences in relative density between previously degraded reforested and enriched areas. We conclude that orang-utan nest surveys from drones are a promising survey metho...},

However, problems with safety, cost, statistical integrity, and logistics continue to impede aerial surveys from manned aircraft. The use of small, unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) may offer promise for addressing these problems and become a useful tool for many wildlife applications, such as for collecting low-altitude aerial imagery. During 2002 and 2003, we used a 1.5-m wingspan {UAV} equipped with autonomous control and sophisticated video equipment to test the potential usefulness of such an aircraft for wildlife research applications in Florida, {USA}. The {UAV} we used completed .30 missions (missions averaging 13 km linear distance covered) over 2 years before finally crashing due to engine failure. The {UAV} captured high-quality, progressive-scan video of a number of landscapes and wildlife species (white ibis Eudocimus albus, other white wading birds, American alligator Alligator mississippiensis, and Florida manatee Trichechus manatus). The {UAV} system was unable to collect georeferenced imagery and was difficult to deploy in unimproved areas. The performance of the autonomous control system and the quality of the progressive-scan imagery indicated strong promise for future {UAVs} as useful field tools. For small {UAVs} to be useful as management or research tools, they should be durable, modular, electric powered, launchable and recoverable in rugged terrain, autonomously controllable, operable with minimal training, and collect georeferenced imagery.},

Spatial and temporal coverage often has to be compromised to make more cost effective the monitoring routine. Nowadays, emerging technologies, can overcome many of these constraints. Here we describe a recent development in remote sensing based on a small unmanned drone ({UAVs}) that produce very fine scale maps of fish nursery areas. This technology is simple to use, inexpensive, and timely in producing aerial photographs of marine areas. Both technical details regarding aerial photos acquisition (drone and camera settings) and post processing workflow (3D model generation with Structure From Motion algorithm and photo-stitching) are given. Finally by applying modern algorithm of semi-automatic image analysis and classification (Maximum Likelihood, {ECHO} and Object-based Image Analysis) we compared the results of three thematic maps of nursery area for juvenile sparid fishes, highlighting the potential of this method in mapping and monitoring coastal marine habitats.},

	abstract = {Conservation of natural ecosystems requires regular monitoring of biodiversity, including the estimation of wildlife density. Recently, unmanned aerial systems ({UAS}) have become more available for numerous civilian applications. The use of small drones for wildlife surveys as a surrogate for manned aerial surveys is becoming increasingly attractive and has already been implemented with some success. This raises the question of how to process {UAS} imagery in order to determine the surface area of sampling strips within an acceptable confidence level. For the purpose of wildlife surveys, the estimation of sampling strip surface area needs to be both accurate and quick, and easy to implement. As {GPS} and an inertial measurement units are commonly integrated within unmanned aircraft platforms, two methods of direct georeferencing were compared here. On the one hand, we used the image footprint projection ({IFP}) method, which utilizes collinearity equations on each image individually. On the other hand, the Structure from Motion ({SfM}) technique was used for block orientation and georeferencing. These two methods were compared on eight sampling strips. An absolute orientation of the strip was determined by indirect georeferencing using ground control points. This absolute orientation was considered as the reference and was used for validating the other two methods. The {IFP} method was demonstrated to be the most accurate and the easiest to implement. It was also found to be less demanding in terms of image quality and overlap. However, even though a flat landscape is the type most widely encountered in wildlife surveys in Africa, we recommend estimating {IFP} sensitivity at an accentuation of the relief.},

Combining this astronomical detection software with existing machine learning algorithms into a single, automated, end-to-end pipeline, we test the software using aerial video footage taken in a controlled, field-like environment. We demonstrate that the pipeline works reliably and describe how it can be used to estimate the completeness of different observational datasets to objects of a given type as a function of height, observing conditions etc. – a crucial step in converting video footage to scientifically useful information such as the spatial distribution and density of different animal species.

We study the problem of localizing a tagged animal using the audio output of an off-the-shelf receiver mounted on an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ({UAV}). This problem is motivated by the application of taking pictures of bears to document their interactions with the environment after contact with the radio signal has been established. We make two contributions. (1) Received signal character-istics depend on the environment, device and driver charac-teristics as well as target/receiver geometry. Due to complex interactions among these factors, directly estimating range or bearing from the signal may not be possible. Instead, we show that given a sufficient step-size, we can use signal characteristics to compare the proximity of two sensing locations with respect to the source. We present a novel model from data collected in field experiments. (2) Based on this model, we also present a local-search algorithm which drives the {UAV} toward the target. We study the performance of the algorithm in extensive simulations using field measurements. The algorithm has also been implemented on the {UAV} and tested in preliminary experiments.},
